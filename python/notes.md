# 20250730

First read. Confusing. Structure unclear. Currently no metrics what needs to be done, what is off, what is good.

Starting with uv and pre-commit to get coverage and a few metrics

pre-commit
- ruff: 44 errors
- whitespaces and end of files: a few
- pytest


radon cc:

Main function has bad maintainability

Average complexity: A (4.3)
- could be better

Tests:
